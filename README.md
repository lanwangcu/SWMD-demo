# SWMD-demo
The applied oscilloscope model was Keysight DSOX2014A. Input the address of oscilloscope to connect.

Parameters (Initial period of SWMD signal, system inductance, etc.) need to be measured and input main.py first.

Parameters in Function-calculation period (calT) need to be adjusted based on oscilloscope settings and SWMD signal frequency.

After input and adjust all of the parameters, the code can be run directly in main.py.

The functions to control the Keysight oscilloscope referred Keysight InfiniiVision 2000 X-Series Oscilloscopes Programmer's Guide.

Thank you.
